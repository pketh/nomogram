# nomogram

Pour one out for those who've felt the pain of design review tools and you'd be all out of gin üç∏.

Hopefully this doesn't suck.

## Philosophy

- The design is never more important than the discussion
- Just a tool for reviews - prototyping is a separate problem
- No friction for reviewers
- Emoji support? Of course. :rainbow:
